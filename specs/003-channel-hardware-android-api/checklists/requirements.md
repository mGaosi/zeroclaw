# Specification Quality Checklist: Optional Channel and Hardware Modules

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - *Note*: Cargo feature flag terminology is inherent to the feature domain — the feature IS about build-time feature gating. This is acceptable.
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - *Note*: SC-001/SC-002 reference Cargo feature names because the feature itself is about Cargo feature flags. Metrics (compile success, dependency count reduction) are technology-agnostic.
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 16 checklist items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- Two items have notes about Cargo-specific terminology being inherent to the feature's domain rather than leaked implementation details.
